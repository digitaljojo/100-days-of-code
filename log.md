# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Note: Until I become more proficient with GitHub, in each of my log updates, I'll include the last lesson I've completed successfully from FreeCodeCamp. I'm looking into learning how to navigate the site better along my journey!

### Day 1: March 20, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp. I started my Twitter to track my progress.

**Thoughts** I've recently started getting back into coding, and it's a great feeling. I still get kinda stuck with a few concepts in Javascript since I've done some work in Java before.

### Day 2: March 21, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I definitely spent over two or three hours burning through exercises. I decided my "rubber ducky" of choice will be a Pikachu figurine I was gifted that now sits atop my monitor. 

**Thoughts** Regular expressions are rather tricky concept for me to grasp. I felt dumb a lot of the times because I felt my regex would work only to have a singular case out of the 10 or so not match. Hints were, sad to say it, necessary and helful for me to understand what I can do better. Navigating the console and learning different debugging methods was actually a lot of fun!

### Day 3: March 22, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: After finishing the last bit of regex exercises and breaking down the answers to better understand the logic, I definitely feel I need a few extra lessons on them. Currently slugging away through the Data Structures lesson and stuck on getting the depth exercise correct.
**Thoughts** When I finish this section on data structures on FreeCodeCamp, I'm considering taking a small break from the coursework and doing some side projectsin HTML and CSS to stay fresh with those skills. I think just going ham learning might lead me to a quick burnout, so I'm going to work on some future portfolio projects.

### Day 4: March 23, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Moved onto algoriths. I still recall a lot from my lessons in Java so relatively easy. A few oolies here and there.

**Thoughts** Doing algotrithms is incredibly exhilerating to me. I love solving problems and seeing ways where I can improve my coding proficiency. If I solve a problem that took me a long time or a lot of code, I like to look at solutions to see how I can do better in the future.
