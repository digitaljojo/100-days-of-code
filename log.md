# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Note: Until I become more proficient with GitHub, in each of my log updates, I'll include the last lesson I've completed successfully from FreeCodeCamp. I'm looking into learning how to navigate the site better along my journey!

## Week 1  

### Day 1: March 20, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp. I started my Twitter to track my progress.

**Thoughts** I've recently started getting back into coding, and it's a great feeling. I still get kinda stuck with a few concepts in Javascript since I've done some work in Java before.

### Day 2: March 21, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I definitely spent over two or three hours burning through exercises. I decided my "rubber ducky" of choice will be a Pikachu figurine I was gifted that now sits atop my monitor. 

**Thoughts** Regular expressions are rather tricky concept for me to grasp. I felt dumb a lot of the times because I felt my regex would work only to have a singular case out of the 10 or so not match. Hints were, sad to say it, necessary and helful for me to understand what I can do better. Navigating the console and learning different debugging methods was actually a lot of fun!

### Day 3: March 22, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: After finishing the last bit of regex exercises and breaking down the answers to better understand the logic, I definitely feel I need a few extra lessons on them. Currently slugging away through the Data Structures lesson and stuck on getting the depth exercise correct.
**Thoughts** When I finish this section on data structures on FreeCodeCamp, I'm considering taking a small break from the coursework and doing some side projectsin HTML and CSS to stay fresh with those skills. I think just going ham learning might lead me to a quick burnout, so I'm going to work on some future portfolio projects.

### Day 4: March 23, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Moved onto algoriths. I still recall a lot from my lessons in Java so relatively easy. A few oolies here and there.

**Thoughts** Doing algotrithms is incredibly exhilerating to me. I love solving problems and seeing ways where I can improve my coding proficiency. If I solve a problem that took me a long time or a lot of code, I like to look at solutions to see how I can do better in the future.

### Day 5: March 24, Thursday

**Today's Progress**  Finished Algorithms and Data Structures, Object Oriented Programming, and now I'm moving more into Functional Programming. I learned a bit more how to utilize the .map() function, albeit with some difficulty. I also uploaded my first commit to GitHub and made my second repository (first that wasn't just assigned to me at account creation).

**Thoughts** Definitely need to take the weekend for some coding relaxation with HTML and CSS practice. GitHub is super helpful in their Docs to say how to do certain tasks. Making a file, uploading it, and doing editing were easily understood. As far as repositories go, that seems like a topic to be delved into more soon. Gonna try to make some webapages witth the HTML and CSS I know to upload and display.

### Day 6: March 25, Friday

**Today's Progess** After finishing the functional Programming section on FCC, I've started to dive into the Intermediate Algorithm section. Definitely a new challenge.

**Thoughts** I am SUPER appreciate for STack Overflow and websites of the like. The issue I'm having with my current code is trying to use the value of an object as the comparison value against other objects nested in an array. I've gotten much better at writing arrow functions to properly what I want with minimal compiling errors. Also learned that functions for objects could be chained together which definitely helped my progress a lot in getting closer to solving my problem.

### Day 7: March 26, Saturday

**Today's Progress** Knocked out three of the intermediate algorithm problems. Most of my day was spent gaining a better comprehension of Object key value pairs and accessing them in the "What's In a Name" challenge from FCC.

**Thoughts** I have far more tenacity than I thought. Doing more Sudoku might be a good idea to help my brain stay active when I get tired of looking at code. Also beating the punching bag at the gym... great for stress relief when an algorithm is gettting the better of me. Walking away if I can't make progress in 20 minutes is a rule I need to stand by- it helps coming backk refreshed to a problem.

## Week 2

### Days 8-9: March 27 & 28, Sunday and Monday

**Progress Made** Still slugging away at the intermediate algorithms in the FreeCodeCamp bootcamp for Javascript. A lot of small "aha" moments of debugging by changing direction.

**Thoughts** I also decided to watch a video on the negative aspects of being a developer/software engineer, and I'm honestly not upset. I knew this path would be one of constant learning, and I think I'll enjoy the path I take. I want to do this because I have a love of problem solving and helping others. Who knows what side projects I'll start soon, but I really can say I am glad I've restarted down this path. I do, however, need to work on a schedule so I can adequately balance my life and obligations. I'm still focusing on losing weight, so I need to make sure coding doesn't interfere with other aspects.

### Days 10-11: March 29 & 30, Tuesday and Wednesday

**Progress Made:** The algorithm problems are getting more difficult for me, as I'd expect, in the challenges. Some I breeze through with minimal effort while other concepts had had my brain puzzled for a hot minute. My current struggle has been with the Optional Arguments challenge. As a break from JS, I decided to start working on a porfolio site to house my artworks.

**Thoughts** Working with the arguments objct is a lot more difficult than I expected. I see how much flexibility it has but it still eludes me in so many ways. Also it was refreshing going back to HTML/CSS. I added BongoCat to my VSCode extensions as a little boost of happiness while I work!

### Day 12: March 31, Thursday

**Progress Made** After doing research on currying and asking a friend for insight, I completed the challenge. It took way longer than desired, but I can see the end in sight.

**Thoughts** My aha moments have hit me sooner and sooner, each leading me down a path of discovery. Instead of taking notes, I am utilizing the comments in each of my codes to document any of the lessons learned from my previous endeavors.

### Days 13 and 14: April 1& 2, Friday and Saturday:

**Progress Made** After much struggle and mind racking, I actually completed the Javascript track on FreeCodeCamp! It was grueling but I would definitely say a worthy endeavor. I took the rest of Saturday off to catch up on Attack on Titan.

**Thoughts** I am so glad I have embraced the approach of writing my logic before attempting to code anything. It significantly speeds up the process of debugging. One of the best examples of this was with my cash register problem; writing in my notebook let me see where my flaws were and literally trace out my problem.

## Week 3

### Day 15: April 3, Sunday:

**Progress Made** Today I started learning more about front end libraries on FreeCodeCamp and then started messing around with my Github page a bit more. Took a day off of heavylogic and coding as a way of staying disciplined but not overexerting myself.

### Day 16-18: April 4-6, Monday- Wednesday:

**Progress Made** Continuing along the track for Front End Libraries. Learne about jQuery, Bootstrap, and React frameworks for Javascript. Also started Codewars and I have progressed from 8 kyu to 6 kyu.

**Thoughts** I was always wondering why the hate for jQuery, but the brief moments of it I saw were enough to convicne me why people call it antiquated. React just is so much more robust and useful in comparison and I've only started to scratch the surface. The tutorial for FCC feels hard to gfollow at times. Maybe I should actually start taking notes? Dealing with state has been complicated because I don't knwo when to use or bind the correct properties. Notation can be difficult to remember how to actually call functions inside return statements.
